# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This repository contains EDA on 2 datasets. 
### 1. AquaStat
Using the open-sourced data(AquaStat) by Food and Agriculture organization http://www.fao.org/home/en/ of the United Nation's, I am trying to analysis:
## Is water availability and water use related to GDP per capita?

The EDA process includes the below steps:
1. Data wrangling
2. Data profiling
3. Univariate data analysis
4. Bivariate data analysis
5. Assess the relationship between each varible and the target variable

### 2. RedCard
The dataset for this taken from the paper, https://osf.io/gvm2z/
This analysis tries to answer the question, 
## Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than light-skin-toned players?
 Data tidying is the major part of this analysis. In the resources floder of RedCard, you can find a reference book for Data Tidying.
